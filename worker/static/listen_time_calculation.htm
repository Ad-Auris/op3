        Listen Time Calculation
    </h1>
    <div class="basic max-w-2xl mx-auto px-8">
        <p>OP3 primarily <a href="/download-calculation">computes "Downloads"</a>, which is the current industry-standard way of measuring a podcast's audience.</p>
        <p>Downloads measure server-side requests, an upper-bound estimate of actual listener plays, but not an exact measurement.  Only the podcast player app knows which episodes a listener actually plays, and which segments of the audio they listen to.</p>
        <p>If all player apps in the open podcast ecosystem shared anonymized client-side playback information with podcasters, it would provide a fuller picture of which parts of their shows are connecting or not with their listeners - above and beyond the relatively opaque metric of a download.</p>

        <h2 id="how">How does OP3 calculate listen time?</h2>
        <p>It turns out <a href="#apps">eight podcast apps</a> already provide a decent approximation of this client-side playback information via an existing mechanism: <a href="https://support.fountain.fm/article/50-how-to-support-podcasts-on-fountain#howsupport">enabling listeners to send small digital payments every minute</a>.</p>
        <p>As a podcaster, you can take a look at the received data directly, or include services in the payment that can aggregate streaming payment statistics on your behalf.</p>
        <p>If OP3 is included in this loop, it can now display this information in a special "Listen time" section in your OP3 show stats page. <a href="/show/fb3d03641442410e881acb0562ef27c6">Example →</a></p>
        <p>While not all podcast apps support this, and not all listeners will choose to send these payments, it's better than no cross-app-comparable client-side data at all - and useful to analyze in addition to server-side downloads.</p>

        <h2 id="enable">How do I enable listen time on my OP3 page?</h2>
        <p>For podcasters that have already <a href="/setup">enabled OP3</a> for their podcast:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the <code>podcast:valueRecipient</code> information from <a href="https://reflex.livewire.io/">reflex.livewire.io</a> to your podcast RSS feed (ignore the chapters part).</li>
            <li>That's it! Reflex will automatically send OP3 anonymized, aggregate stats based on any incoming data observed, and display it on the show page.</li>
            <li>Encourage your listeners to use one of the apps below to listen to your show, and encourage them to support your show with streaming payments.</li>
        </ul>
